The intention was to prevent a thermal shock that could occur if a large volume of cold water—approximately 350 m³—was suddenly introduced into the hot reactor core. This sudden change in temperature could potentially cause cracks in the uranium fuel rods or graphite moderators; however, it also could have greatly reduced the amount of steam in the core and prevented the explosion.\n\nAt this time, the reactor is operating at half-power of 1600 megawatts, and is planned to be lowered even further. However, a load dispatcher in the city of Kiev requests that the shutdown be postponed due to high demand for electricity. This request results in the test being delayed 9 hours, during which time the reactor continues to operate in an unstable, low-power state with the emergency cooling system disconnected.',

          label: 'Reduction of Power is Resumed',
          description: 'Xenon poisoning is a phenomenon in nuclear reactors caused by the buildup of the fission product Xenon-135, which has a high neutron absorption cross-section and therefore acts as a "poison" by reducing the reactivity of the reactor core. Xe-135 is not produced directly in large quantities during fission but rather forms through the radioactive decay of I-135, another fission product with a half-life of ~6.6 hours. Once formed, Xe-135 can either absorb a neutron—transforming into non-poisonous Xe-136—or decay naturally with a half-life of ~9.2 hours.<br><br>In a reactor operating at stable power, these processes balance out; however, when power is reduced, neutron flux decreases, so xenon production continues while its burn-off slows dramatically. This leads to a condition known as xenon poisoning—an accumulation of Xe-135 in the reactor core, which suppresses reactivity. Recovering from it usually requires either waiting for Xe-135 to decay naturally or manually increasing power to burn it off, which must be done slowly to avoid instability. However, instead of raising power to recover from Xenon poisoning, the operators further reduced the reactor\'s power output as part of the test preparation. This decision pushed the reactor into an even deeper iodine pit.',

Anatoliy Dyatlov, the deputy chief engineer, remained on-site to oversee the experiment. This change in personnel meant that those responsible for managing the reactor during the most critical phases were not the same people who had overseen its earlier condition changes. The transition introduced a level of discontinuity and potential confusion in handling the increasingly unstable reactor.',

          description: 'An additional coolant pump was brought online, increasing the flow rate through the reactor. In an RBMK, coolant flows through individual pressure tubes containing the fuel, surrounded by a graphite moderator. The reactor’s power level directly affects how much of the coolant boils into steam: lower power means less boiling, less steam, and therefore lower hydraulic resistance. At this point, the low power level meant hydraulic resistance in the system had dropped significantly, allowing roughly 60,000 cubic meters per hour of water to circulate through the reactor, compared to the standard 45,000. This change in flow rate fundamentally altered the reactor’s behavior.',

Although the turbine was disconnected, the reactor continued producing heat and steam, leading to a sudden pressure spike in the steam lines and drum separators.<br><br>Meanwhile, with the turbine no longer driving the pumps at full capacity, the overall coolant flow through the reactor decreased. In an RBMK, this is dangerous because of the positive void coefficient. The void coefficient of reactivity measures how a nuclear reactor’s reactivity changes in response to changes in steam and water levels within the core. The RBMK reactor’s positive void coefficient means that an increase in steam leads to an increase in reactivity; as steam replaces liquid water in the coolant channels, neutron absorption decreases, reactivity increases, and heat generation accelerates. This results in a positive feedback loop of reactivity, which, once begun, can be extremely difficult to stop.',

This is supposed to immediately insert all of the control rods back into the core, halting the reaction.

At that same moment, Valeriy Ivanovich Perevozchenko, the on-duty chief of the reactor shop, observed the blocks of the upper biological shield begin “jumping” in their channels, a clear sign that small explosions were already occurring deep within the core. Coolant flow rates continued to drop until the reactor was entirely cut off from water. Without this cooling to remove heat produced by ongoing fission reactions, the zirconium alloy cladding around the fuel assemblies vaporized and ruptured, allowing intensely radioactive fuel pellets to spill into the heart of the reactor. The hot zirconium metal then reacted with the steam in a redox reaction, which can be represented by the equation Zr (s) + 2 H₂O (g) → ZrO₂ (s) + 2 H₂ (g). This exothermic reaction released roughly 150 kJ per mole of zirconium, further heating the already overheated core. The buildup of pressure caused drum separators, steam-water pipelines, and lower water pipes to rupture in quick succession, producing two muffled explosion sounds.',
