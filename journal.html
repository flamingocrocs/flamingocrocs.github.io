	<h3>10.02.22</h3>
	<p>After about 2-3 weeks of Comp Sci 1, I'm pretty excited to start really working on my website. We've learned about how <strong>HTML creates the content of a website and CSS creates the format,</strong> and used that to make our <strong>person cards.</strong> Today I watched videos about the web and using tags in HTML, which I'm using to make this journal entry!</p>

	<h3>10.12.22</h3>
	i made my website look cool now i just have to update the content-- i want to work on my about me page and maybe start some projects for my projects page (which is atrocious)

	<h3>11.7.22</h3>
	last week i made a website page for tara using javascript event listeners, which she taught us in class. it kind of made me want to make a gvs page, so that might be my next codesketch.
