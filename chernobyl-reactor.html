          { title: "Reactor Core", description: "The reactor core is the heart of the reactor, where nuclear energy is generated through the fission of uranium-235.", image: "reactor-core.jpg" },
          { title: "Fuel", description: "Inside the core, nuclear reactions take place within the fuel assemblies. Each assembly is a bundle of uranium dioxide pellets stacked inside thin tubes of zirconium-niobium alloy cladding, and placed inside a stack of graphite blocks. As the reactor operates, fission occurs when a neutron strikes a U-235 nucleus, splitting it into smaller radioactive fragments (Cs-137, I-131, Sr-90). Unlike most Western reactors, the RBMK reactor uses non-enriched uranium dioxide (UO₂) fuel. This fuel has a lower concentration of the reactive Uranium-235,  and thus requires a powerful moderator to sustain a chain reaction.", image: "fuel-assemblies.jpg" },
          { title: "Graphite Moderator", description: "A lattice of graphite blocks act as a neutron moderator, slowing down fast neutrons and making them more likely to collide with a U-235 molecule and start a fission reaction. The graphite doesn’t chemically react with the fuel or coolant under normal conditions, but at high temperatures, it can react with oxygen (C + O₂ → CO₂), which is why oxygen infiltration into the core is dangerous.", image: "core-graphite.jpg" },
           { title: "Control Rods", description: "To regulate the reactor’s power, boron carbide control rods are inserted into specific channels in the core. These work by capturing neutrons, thus reducing the rate of fission reactions. Operators can control the number of rods in the core, as well as how far into the core they are inserted, thereby controlling reactivity levels. However, the RBMK’s design included a dangerous flaw: the control rods had graphite tips at their lower ends. If, for any reason, the control rods were to be pulled entirely out of the reactor, when they are inserted back in, the graphite tips momentarily increase reactivity.", image: "control-rods.jpg" }

        ]
      },
      { id: 2, title: "Steamwater Pipes", description: "Each reactor has four main circulation loops, each with its own set of steamwater pipes, pumps, and drum separators. As the reactor operates, coolant water absorbs large amounts of heat, partially boiling and forming a two-phase mixture of liquid water and steam. This steam-water mixture exits the reactor core through a system of hundreds of steam riser pipes, which carry it to the drum separators.", image: "steamwater-pipes.jpg" },
      { id: 3, title: "Drum Separators", description: "Drum separators are massive, horizontal steel cylinders mounted above the reactor core, acting as the key component for separating steam from water in the coolant loop. Steamwater pipes deliver a two-phase mixture of liquid and steam to drum separators, where it is sorted using gravity, inertia, and cyclone separators. Dense liquid water naturally sinks to the bottom of the drum, while the lighter steam rises to the top. The dry steam is then sent off to spin the turbines and generate electricity, while the liquid water is returned to the reactor core, to be reused as coolant.", image: "drum-separator.jpg" },
      { id: 4, title: "Main Circulation Pumps", description: "TThe main circulation pumps are designed to keep water constantly flowing through the reactor core. They push pressurized water from the bottom of the core, through the fuel channels, and back up into the drum separators, effectively maintaining the reactor’s entire cooling system. Each RBMK reactor has eight of these pumps, with four active during normal operation—one for each of the main coolant loops—and the others ready as backups. The smooth operation of circulation pumps is also vital for reactor stability: if one fails, the flow rate in that loop drops, which can reduce cooling in the core and create a dangerous heat imbalance.", image: "main-pumps.jpg" },
      { id: 5, title: "Group Distribution Manifold", description: "Another large piping structure, which takes feedwater from the circulation pumps and evenly distributes it into more pipelines that feed back into the core.", image: "group-distribution.jpg" },
      { id: 6, title: "Water Pipelines", description: "These smaller channels are fed with coolant water by the group distribution system, and then feed that water directly back into the fuel channels in the reactor core, effectively continuing the coolant loop. To keep this entire system balanced, rotameters are installed in the pipelines to monitor the water flow rates. A rotameter is a sensor that uses a float in a tapered tube to measure flow rate; as the water flows, it lifts the float, showing how much water is moving through.", image: "water-pipelines-rotameter.jpg" },
      { id: 7, title: "Side Biological Shield", description: "The biological shields in an RBMK reactor are thick layers of materials that surround the reactor core, designed to absorb and block radiation so it doesn’t escape into the environment. The shields work because radiation, especially gamma rays and fast neutrons, is highly penetrating, but dense materials like concrete, graphite, lead, and steel can absorb or slow down these particles. The RBMK has three main biological shields: the side, upper, and lower shields. The side biological shield surrounds the reactor laterally.", image: "side-shield.jpg" },
      { id: 8, title: "Upper Biological Shield", description: "The upper biological shield sits on top of the reactor core, providing radiation protection for personnel and equipment above the core. At Chornobyl, the UBS weighed around 2000 tons.", image: "upper-shield.jpg" },
      { id: 9, title: "Lower Biological Shield", description: "Counterpart to the upper shield; it sits beneath the reactor core and absorbs any radiation emitted downwards.", image: "lower-shield.jpg" },
      { id: 10, title: "Refueling Machine", description: "One of the most unique features of the RBMK reactor is its ability to be refueled while still operating at full power, thanks to a specialized refueling machine. In most other reactors (such as pressurized water reactors (PWRs) or boiling water reactors (BWRs), the designs used in the West), the entire reactor has to be shut down for refueling, interrupting power generation. The RBMK, however, uses a vertical refueling system that allows operators to replace fuel assemblies without stopping the reactor. This system was chosen to maximize electricity production; continuous refueling meant more power output. Also, the ability to operate continuously enabled the production of weapons-grade plutonium, another goal of the Soviet designers. The refuelling machine itself is a massive, remotely controlled crane that moves along rails above the reactor core. It aligns with individual fuel channels and uses a long mechanical arm to remove spent fuel assemblies and insert fresh ones.", image: "refuelling-machine.jpg" },
      { id: 11, title: "Gantry Crane", description: "The gantry crane is a large overhead crane system that moves components like the refuelling machine, fuel assemblies, and equipment for maintenance. It spans across the reactor hall, allowing for easy transport of these parts between different areas, including the reactor core, fuel storage pool, and other maintenance stations.", image: "gantry-crane.jpg" },
      { id: 12, title: "Spent Fuel Storage Pool", description: "The spent fuel storage pool is where used fuel assemblies are stored after they’re removed from the core. The pool is filled with water, which cools the spent fuel and provides radiation shielding. The water acts as both a heat sink and a biological shield because freshly removed fuel is still highly radioactive and generates a lot of decay heat. The pool also allows for long-term cooling before the fuel is either reprocessed or stored permanently.", image: "refuelling-machine.jpg" }
